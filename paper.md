Semantic Web technologies enable Trustworthy and Accountable conversational agents at a Web Scale.

Conversational agents are becoming an increasingly popular topic of research within the LLM community. In particular AutoGen has over 23.2k stars on GiHub and [x] citations. Devin the “worlds first AI software engineer” has received $23M in seed funding, and …

Problem Statement:
How can autonomous, semi-autonomous and other systems safely participate in interactions on the Web that have real-world outcomes.

Solution (sketch):

We consider [x] use cases to demonstrate
