Things to do in the future:
 - Make sure inputs are canonicalised before passing them to the model.
 - Apply any contextualisation to the data
 - Make sure data & questions are grounded before sending requests
 - Make interactions more "proactive" (i.e. less requesting of elevated permissions to forward data etc.)
